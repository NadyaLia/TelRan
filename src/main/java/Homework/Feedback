Feedback from an IT Specialist to a Colleague
Subject: Feedback on Recent Project Performance

Dear Robin,

I hope you're doing well. Do you have a few minutes to discuss the progress of our ongoing project?
I have some observations that I believe could help us move forward more effectively.

Data Points:
I noticed that the code for the new feature was supposed to be completed by last Friday, but it's still in progress.
During our last team meeting, you mentioned that you would update the project documentation, but it hasn't been updated yet.

Impact:
The delay in code completion has pushed back our testing phase, affecting the overall project timeline.
The lack of updated documentation makes it challenging for other team members to understand the changes,
causing delays in their respective tasks.

Next Steps:
I understand that we all have multiple responsibilities and sometimes deadlines can be missed.
However, it's crucial for the success of our project that we meet our individual milestones.

How do you see the situation? Do you have any challenges that you'd like to discuss, or do you need any additional
resources to help you meet your goals?

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,
Nadja
