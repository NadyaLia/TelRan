How to answer

Past (Success):
I graduated from Belarusian State University, Biology Faculty and for the past several years, I've been involved in
various international nature protection projects. My role as a scientist required a high level of organization, data
analysis, and problem-solving. This experience sparked my interest in programming and led me to explore Java development.

Present (Strength):
Recently, I've been dedicating my time to learning Java and other relevant technologies. I've completed several courses
and have been working on personal projects to solidify my understanding and gain practical experience. One of my recent
projects involved developing an application for data analysis in one of the projects I was
involved in. This project was successful in streamlining the data analysis process and it reinforced my interest in
programming. My real strength is my ability to quick learn. As a biologist, I got used to adapt to new research
techniques and methodologies. Also, I understand that attention to detail is crucial to conducting accurate experiments.
I did a lot of them in my life and can be sure that I'm very accurate during coding.

Future (Situation):
I am looking for a company where I can add value as a Java developer. I'm eager to apply my unique background in biology,
nature protection, and programming to a team where I can contribute to ongoing projects and help solve problems. I am
particularly interested in a role where I can leverage my strong organizational skills and attention to detail.
